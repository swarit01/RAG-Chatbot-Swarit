# Prophet-Chatbot
Prophet Team!

Hope this chatbot finds you well. To run this code, please have a Docker instance of ChromaDB running on port 8000.

**Prerequisites**:

You'll need to create the collection, and then provide that collectionID to ChromaCRUDHelper.java. ChromaCRUDHelper will execute the logic to ingest the dataset of choice (https://huggingface.co/datasets/TaylorAI/pubmed_other), as well as persist that information to Chroma.

** To Run the Chatbot (Raj):**

Please run the main method in the ChatBot.java class. 


If you have any questions, you can shoot me an email - swarit01@gmail.com or drop a text/phone call @ 510-589-5041
